Course Description

An intermediate hands-on studio course in 3D computer animation. Students will complete several small assignments that are designed to encourage creativity, develop a further skill with the tools and techniques of animation. 

Course Structure

3D Animation is a studio class. Students should be prepared to work on their projects in class. Coming to class unprepared will be marked as an absence.

Requirements

1.)There will be several small projects leading up to a final project. Satisfactory completion of these projects and participation during in-class critiques is mandatory for credit. Critiques are not optional.

2.) Late arrivals, early departures and unexcused absences are frowned upon. Only 3 unexcused absences will be allowed. If you need an offical excuse, go to the Student Experience office: 4th floor of Academy Hall, x8022, se@rpi.edu. Every additional absence will result in the lowering of the final grade be a letter. It is the student's responsibility to make up material missed due to an absence; the professor does not provide lecture notes to students who miss class.
