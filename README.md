##Course Description

An intermediate hands-on studio course in 3D computer animation. Students will complete several small assignments that are designed to encourage creativity, develop a further skill with the tools and techniques of animation. Pre-reqs: Arts 4060 or permission of the instructor

##Course Structure

3D Animation is a studio class. Students should be prepared to work on their projects in class. Coming to class unprepared will be marked as an absence.

##Requirements

1.) There will be several small projects leading up to a final project. Satisfactory completion of these projects and participation during in-class critiques is mandatory for credit. Critiques are not optional.

2.) Late arrivals, early departures and unexcused absences are frowned upon. Only 3 unexcused absences will be allowed. If you need an offical excuse, go to the Student Experience office: 4th floor of Academy Hall, x8022, se@rpi.edu. Every additional absence will result in the lowering of the final grade be a letter. It is the student's responsibility to make up material missed due to an absence; the professor does not provide lecture notes to students who miss class.

##Learning Outcomes

By the completion of the course:

*Students will be able to use key frames and adjust key frame interpolation via the Graph Editor
